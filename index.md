# Welcome!

## üîπ About Me
I am a researcher at the **Hana Institute of Technology (HIT)**, focusing on **AI-driven virtual human systems**, including facial motion synthesis, real-time lip-syncing, and generative AI models. Previously, I worked as a researcher at the **Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI)**, developing **AI-based radiation monitoring and anomaly detection systems**.  

I completed my M.S. in **Electrical Engineering at KAIST**, advised by **Prof. Young-Gyu Yoon**, where I researched **computational imaging and deep learning for medical applications**. I earned my B.S. in **Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from GIST**, and began my career as a **research officer at the Agency for Defense Development (ADD)**, specializing in **computer vision and satellite image analysis**.
